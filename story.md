Chapter One: Dawn’s Molten Crave The Tisza River burned pink under Szeged’s dawn, its waters rippling like a teased, slick slit. Dóri’s sneakers pounded the path, her body a furnace of lust. Tight black leggings with lace cutouts molded her ass, the sheer fabric flashing her thong’s outline with every stride. Her cropped pink sports bra, scooped low, hugged her bouncing tits, nipples straining, kissed raw by the dawn’s chill bite. Sweat dripped down her cleavage, pooling where her pussy throbbed, wet and ravenous. Her smartwatch buzzed—a Szeged forum post flashing Tamás’s photo, his pharmacy coat parted, chiseled pecs screaming to be touched. Dóri’s glossy lips parted, eyes sharp with liner glazing over, her cunt clenching tight. She pictured him slamming her against a bench, tearing her leggings, his thick cock plunging into her soaked hole, fucking her until she howled. The fantasy drenched her thong, hips grinding as she slowed, fingers grazing her clit through the lace, sparking a filthy moan, cheeks flushed hot and rosy. A “Bambiland” café sign glowed in the distance, sparking visions of lacy panties under her uniform at work, Tamás’s eyes raking her curves. Rosie’s text pinged: Girls’ night at my flat—tomorrow night! don’t be late ;). Dóri’s thighs clamped, craving Tamás’s cock but buzzing for the night’s tease. At home, she couldn’t help herself, she sprawled on her pink velvet couch, fingers diving into her thong, fucking herself to his name, cum flooding as she shook. Showered, she slipped into a fitted pharmacy skirt and blouse, strutting to work with a slutty sway, her bimbo fire blazing to consume him. 🌹
Chapter Two: Counter’s Wicked Heat The Szeged pharmacy pulsed, fluorescent lights glinting off pill bottles, a “Bimbo Pharmacy” sign flaring pink cursive above the counter. Dóri stood poised, her tight white blouse—unbuttoned to tease cleavage—molding her curves, a navy skirt with a slit riding her thighs. Her long brown hair spilled in glossy waves, cheeks rosy under winged liner, glossy lips smirking as she handed out prescriptions, her cunt still dripping from the morning’s rush. Tamás worked nearby, broad shoulders flexing under his coat, dark eyes hooking hers with a smolder. She leaned over the counter, blouse gaping to flaunt her tits, picturing him bending her over it, cock ramming her wet pussy until she screamed. A customer asked about flu meds; Dóri purred, “This’ll soothe you, darling,” her voice dripping honey, hips rolling as she turned, praying Tamás saw. His quick glance, lips twitching, set her ablaze, her pussy soaking her lace panties. During a lull, Dóri slipped to the break room—a cramped den with a pink couch, a “Bambiland” mug by the coffee maker. Alone, she hiked her skirt, fingers plunging into her thong, rubbing her swollen clit as she imagined Tamás bursting in, fucking her against the wall, cum spilling down her thighs. The door creaked—Katalin strolled in, heading to the coffee counter, oblivious. Dóri yanked her fingers out, thighs squeezing tight, cheeks burning with embarrassment, her cunt throbbing harder from the near miss. “He’s trouble,” she stammered, nodding toward Tamás’s silhouette. Katalin, stirring coffee, grinned unaware, their banter light but charged.

The fantasy drenched her lace panties, hips rolling provocatively. Ducking into a fitting room, Dóri tried the dress, its sheer fabric clinging, nipples hard. Craving a thrill, she pulled a cheeky butt plug from her bag—a private indulgence—and eased it in, its pressure sparking a filthy moan as she posed, her cunt throbbing. The risk of creaky floorboards betraying her made her cheeks burn, arousal spiking. She adjusted the dress, picturing Tamás’s eyes at Rosie’s girls’ night. At checkout, a clerk’s flirty smile lingered. A “Bambiland” sign glowed outside, fueling thoughts of Tamás devouring her.

Her lips parted, cheeks flushed as her fingers grazed her thigh, the day’s thrills pulsing in her tight little pussy. As Dóri sank into the couch, lightly running her finger along her swollen clit, she melted into heat, picturing Tamás kneeling between her thighs, his lips sucking her tight wet pussy, teeth nibbling her slick folds, tongue diving deep until she screamed.
